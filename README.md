 Week-10 # Star Wars API App

This is a web application that allows users to explore data from the Star Wars universe using the Star Wars API (SWAPI). Users can fetch information about characters, planets, and more, and view the data displayed on the webpage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the buttons to fetch data about characters, planets, etc.
4. Explore the data displayed on the webpage.

## Features

- Fetch data from the Star Wars API using asynchronous JavaScript (async/await).
- Display data dynamically on the webpage using Bootstrap cards.
- Responsive design ensures the application looks good on various devices.

## Enhancements

- Add additional buttons to fetch more data, such as species, vehicles, etc.
- Implement sorting or filtering options to make the displayed data more interactive.
- Improve the appearance of the application with custom CSS styles.
- Add pagination if the data returned by the API is extensive.

## Deployment

You can deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) to make it accessible to others.
